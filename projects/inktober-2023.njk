<p class='intro'>
	I participated in Inktober, a month-long drawing challenge to draw everyday in October. It's usually accompanied by a prompt list, however I did not follow it this year. I chose to just draw as many days as possible and I ended up drawing 21/31!

{% set baseFileName = 'inktober' %}
{% set maxIndex = 21 %} 

{% for i in range(1, maxIndex + 1) %}
<div class='img'>
	<picture>
		<source srcset='/images/projects/inktober-2023/{{ baseFileName }}{{ i }}@3x.webp 3x' type='image/webp' media='(min-width: 1200px)'>
		<img class='img-fluid' src='/images/projects/inktober-2023/{{ baseFileName }}{{ i }}.jpg' srcset='/images/projects/inktober-2023/{{ baseFileName }}{{ i }}@2x.jpg 2x' alt='{{ baseFileName }}{{ i }}' >
	</picture>
</div>
