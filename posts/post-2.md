All the major milestones accomplished in mobile gaming were all preceded by features first implemented by the Nintendo DS and 3DS and their developers. Nintendo has had amazing ideas over the years and while the Switch is the best selling console of this generation, it could have been so much more. 

Let's take a look at some of these milestones:
- Spotpass. An asynchronous tagging feature that passed information whenever you passed someone else with Spotpass on. Some games used this feature for in-game incentives to players. This paved the way for "Words with Friends." 
- Pokemon Go should have happened on the Nintendo DS.
