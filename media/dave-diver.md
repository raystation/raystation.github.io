<p class='intro'>
	Just started playing this game and it's so simple in design. You play Dave, a diver hired to explore a mysterious new deep water ravine that appeared in a lake full of exotic fish.
</p>

There are essentially two phases, diving and a sushi restaurant sim. The fish you find diving gets sent to the restaurant to be served. With each passing day, you dive deeper, find more unique fish, and serve better dishes. Simple and fun.
