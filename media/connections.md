<p class='intro'>
	Another fun game in the NYT games subscription, <i>Connections</i> is one of my favorite games from 2023. 
</p>

Connections is an entertaining word game that challenges you to discover four sets of words in a grid connected by a common theme. While some groups may be straightforward, like colors or states, the real excitement arises when words with multiple meanings are involved, potentially fitting into various categories.

For instance, consider the word SPICE, which may seem associated with PEPPER and SALT on the board, yet it could be a clever distraction meant to mislead you. In reality, it might belong to a group of words concluding with "GIRLS," linking SPICE with INDIGO.

These puzzles are easily accessible on your phone, providing a delightful and engaging experience.

I discovered an online puzzle generator that enables the creation of custom puzzles, and I've been thoroughly enjoying the process of crafting them!
